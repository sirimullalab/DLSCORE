# DLSCORE: A deep learning based scoring function for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity.

Purpose: The main purpose of DLSCORE is to accurately predict binding affinities between a protein (target) and a ligand. 

DLSCORE is an ensemble of neural networks, trained on the recent release of the refined PDBBind data(v2016) using BINding ANAlyzer (BINANA ) descriptors. 


## Installation 

### Virtual environment

- Install MglTools (<a target='_blank' href='http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads'>Source</a>). Make sure `pythonsh` command works in the terminal
- Install the virtualenv: `bash setup.sh`. The script will also make sure the network files are available
- Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`

This virtual environment runs DLScore using the cpu version of tensorflow. To run the GPU version, please use the conda installation described below:

### Conda

- Install the conda environment. `conda env create -f environment_gpu.yml`
- Install MglTools (<a target='_blank' href='http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads'>Source</a>). Make sure `pythonsh` command works in the terminal
- If running on Stampede2 (TACC server), please load the module `intel/18.0.0`
- Download the network files: `./download_networks.sh`

Test the installation by runnning `bash test_run.sh`

## Prediction
For options, run `python dlscore.py -h`

The output will be the following:

```
usage: dlscore.py [-h] --ligand LIGAND --receptor RECEPTOR
                  [--vina_executable VINA_EXECUTABLE]
                  [--num_networks NUM_NETWORKS] [--output OUTPUT_FILE]
                  [--network_type {refined,general}] [--verbose {0,1}]

Main script for running DLSCORE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ligand LIGAND       Ligand file. Supported file types: .pdb, .pdbqt, .mol2
  --receptor RECEPTOR   Receptor file. Supported file types: .pdb, .pdbqt,
                        .mol2
  --vina_executable VINA_EXECUTABLE
                        File path for Vina executable.
  --num_networks NUM_NETWORKS
                        Number of networks to use for prediction. Default:10
  --output OUTPUT_FILE  Name of the output file. Dafault: out.csv
  --network_type {refined,general}
                        DLSCORE has two types of weights trained on PDB-Bind
                        2016 refined set and general set (including refined).
                        Any of these two variants can be used. Possible
                        options are: general and refined. Dafault is set to
                        refined.
  --verbose {0,1}       Verbose mode. False if 0, True if 1. Default is set to
                        False.
```

DLSCORE will be producing the number of networks specified with in `-num_networks`, NNScore 2.0 will display 20, and vina 1 (plus 5) . The output thrown by DLSCORE and NNScore 2.0 are pKd values, while Vina gives delta G (kcal/mol)

The same applies for the rest of the proteins and ligands. To see the rest of the protein-ligand complexes for our dataset (300 from PDBbind v.2016 refined-set), please read our [research article](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.6159143.v1)
