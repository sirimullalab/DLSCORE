# DLSCORE: A deep learning based scoring function for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity.

DLSCORE is an ensemble of the neural networks, trained on the recent release of PDBBind data(v2017) using Binding Analyzer (BINANA ) descriptors. Teh dataset has 4085 samples divided into training (80%), test (10%) and validation set (10%).  DLSCORE acheived R2 of 0.96 for our training set and 0.79 for our test set
